# ultrastar-download
Python downloader for automatically adding music to Ultrastar from a batch file.

Downloads music files to: "C:\Program Files (x86)\UltraStar Deluxe\songs\<song_name>"

Rookiepy was only configured to search for cookies in Microsoft Edge.
It only occurs once in the code, so if you prefer a different browser, simply swapping the single "rookiepy.edge(["usdb.animux.de"])" for a different browser such as "rookiepy.chrome(["usdb.animux.de"])" should work.
Requires an account to be logged in on usdb.animux.de for the script to work.

See the existing batch file for an example of what urls it takes.
